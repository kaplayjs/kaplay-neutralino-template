# KAPLAY + Neutralino.js

Before running nothing, use

```
npm run neu update
```

This template provides various commands:

- `npm run dev` - Develop in the web browser
- `npm run build` - Build for web browser
- `npm run desktop:dev` - Develop in the desktop view
- `npm run desktop:build` - Build for desktop devices

## But I already have a project...

Important things are `neutralino.config.js`, just adapt paths to your files (and if you use another thing than Vite, adapt commands in `cli.frontendLibrary`)
